# 🧠 SmartFiller Chrome Extension

**Learn once, never type it again.**  
SmartFiller is an intelligent browser extension that passively learns as you interact with web forms and automatically fills future forms without requiring configuration, registration, or cloud sync.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

✅ Learns every form field you complete  
✅ Detects and fills the most similar fields using **Levenshtein distance**  
✅ Automatically avoids **search bars**, **chat boxes**, and **already filled inputs**  
✅ Stores everything locally using the **TAFFY** database—**no internet required**  
✅ Works **inside iframes** and **complex layouts**  

> 🔍 If you've ever typed your email address twice on two websites, SmartFiller will make sure you never do it again.

## ✨ Zero-Input Philosophy

This project is a real-world implementation of a **Subjective Technology system**. It eliminates redundant interactions by making user input nearly obsolete. It behaves like a **KnowledgeHook** that watches your behavior and fills forms **as if it were you**—without requiring setup or configuration.

Unlike traditional third-person systems, SmartFiller fills forms subjectively—using your behavior and context to decide what to do.

## 📈 Form Fill Performance Metrics

- Detects when the user has to **type the same thing twice** 🛑  
- Measures how many **corrections are made** before submission ✏️  
- Tracks system intelligence growth through minimized input 📉

---

## 🧾 CHANGELOG – v1.1

- ✅ Avoid filling of search inputs  
- ✅ Detect if the field is inside a search/chat form, skip it  
- ✅ Partial support for fields inside iframes  
- ✅ Do not overwrite pre-filled form fields
