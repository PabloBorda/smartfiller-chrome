  "description": "In contrast to ALL the form fillers around, roboform, Autofill, etc.. This form fillers
  stores every form entry you type, as key value pairs. And then if the loaded page contains an empty
  field, the extension fills it with the value whose key is the most similar (less amount of operations to convert one string into other). You verify that everything is
  OK, modyfy if anything is wrong, and SUBMIT. As simple as that,.. no profiles.. no previously input all fields
  in a form only for the extension.. it just learns from previous forms.. and combines all fields to fill new and different forms.. It
  cannot be possible that today isnt there a tool that avoids you from filling information OVER AND OVER AGAIN.. The shity extensions
  available only fill the email, your name.. and your address.., other fields are too difiult.. as if they
  were not text..FUCK! I GOT TIRED OF THAT STUPID JOB APPLICATIONS!!",
